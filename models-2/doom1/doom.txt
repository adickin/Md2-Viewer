INSTALLATION:
Just unzip into your Quake 2 directory, preserving paths. Or, for difficult people, make a dir
in your baseq2/players directory called doom (it has to be called doom, or Quake won't be able
to find the skins). It's so easy!

OBLIGATORY SPECS (weapon.md2 + tris.md2):
	Tris: 598
	Modeling: 3D Studio Max 2.0
	Animation: Physique module from Character Studio
	Skin: Paint Shop Pro
	Compiling: qME 3.1

I did have some really funny author's notes here, but after getting some sleep I decided that
they weren't that clever after all so I trashed them. Sorry for the inconvenience.

BTW, thanks to Doomguy for creating the Quake 1 player.mdl skin that has become the definitive
concept for the Doom marine character. Much better reference material than those vague bitmaps
ripped from the .wad, I tell you. 

BTW again, distribute this as freely and as wildly as you'd like, but when you do so please keep
this zip and readme intact.
