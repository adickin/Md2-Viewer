Model Name              : Delirium

Model description       : Delirium was created after a friend wanted a 'killer clown' 
			  for a logo on his web page. I like the idea, so I worked up a 
			  clown, and it wound up carrying over to a Q2 PPM as well. This 
			  is my first attempt at a realtime model and represents a LOT of 
			  learning on my part. I made some mistakes along the way, and the
			  model perhaps isn't everything I'd like it to be, but it came out
			  well enough that I thought I'd let everyone have a go with it. There 
			  are 5 skins included, and all of them suffer from the fact that 
			  I don't have much experience skinning realtime models. I had a lot
			  of fun creating this guy, though, so look for more (and better) 
			  PPM's in the future. Feel free to drop me an email to let me know 
			  what you think of the model. Thanks!
