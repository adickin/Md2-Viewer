FanGrin Model with sounds by Brett Brown RELEASED 3/1/98

Hope you like this disgusting freak--his skeletonized fleshy pulpy skin
makes me sick.....I LOVE IT!

Installation:  Unzip the Fangrin into your quake2/baseq2/players/fangrin (yes create a 
	       directory named fangrin).  You my have to rename Fangrin~1 to Fangrin_i
               
               If you have trouble getting it to show up in the
               multiplayer menu, make sure you have NO files
               (besides the directories) in quake2\baseq2\players!
		Also make sure the head file is named Fangrin_i NOT
		Fangrin~1.

Tools used:  Quake2 modeller (yes the entire thing--I know I'm Amazing)
