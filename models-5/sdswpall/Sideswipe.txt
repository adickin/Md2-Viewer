DESCRIPTION

   A plugin player model for Quake2 based on an Autobot 
   character from the Transformers line of toys.


INSTALLATION

   After unzipping the files contained in the archive, put 
   them in a directory called 'Sideswipe', underneath the 
   Quake2\baseq2\players\ folder.

USING Sideswipe IN QUAKE2

   To use Sideswipe go to the mutliplayer setup and choose 
   the Sideswipe model instead of the male or female players.
   He comes with a few different skins (see below).  The Red
   Alert skin was based on a different character who shared 
   the same body construct as Sideswipe.
   
   You're on your own if you want to use Sideswipe with one 
   of the 'bot' programs, I'm afraid.  I haven't had the
   time to play with that.
   
SKINS

   Please feel free to create new skins for Sideswipe. You can 
   send them to me by email: iamseip@erols.com.

SOUNDS

   I hacked together a bunch of sounds to make the player seem
   a little more like a metallic being.  Most are from 2 demos
   I downloaded:  'Shadows of the Empire' and 'Take No Prisoners'.
   One or two Quake2 sounds made their way in there, too.  If you
   don't like them, just delete them and the game will play the 
   default male sounds.

COMMENTS

   Sideswipe is the first of many Transformers that I hope 
   will be produced through the Quake conversion I am leading.
   The conversion is, for the moment, simply referred to as 
   TFQ(Transformers Quake), and will focus on both single- and 
   multi-player gaming that will attempt to bring the Transformers 
   to the Quake realm and give them the game I feel they've always
   deserved.  Currently, the project is located on Geocities.  
   Stop by the site and see what we're up to:

   http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Fortress/3306/TFQ.html

   Please ask if you want to use the model for anything other 
   than personal use as it is explained here, particularly if 
   incuding it in a patch or add-on.  Don't stick it on anything 
   retail...it won't be me coming after you, it'll be Hasbro's 
   big, bad lawyers.

   Now go kick ass.

_______________________________SKIN INFO_______________________________

Here's info on the skins, for those of you that give a crap.


sideswipe.pcx= The original Sideswipe from the 1st wave of Transformers

redalert.pcx=  Released somewhat later. He was really just a repaint 
               with some lights on his roof.

sideswipeg2.pcx= This is the repaint of Sideswipe from the Generation 2
                 series.

Cwclan.pcx=    A non-existant Transformer. I made this skin for my clan
               to use.

burnout.pcx=   Another non-existant Transformer. I made this for Jay for
               the hell of it. I think there actually was a TF with this
               name, I think he was a motorcycle. Anyway, it doesn't 
               matter. We'll just do what they're doing in Beast Wars &
               say, the name was passed on to a new warrior.
