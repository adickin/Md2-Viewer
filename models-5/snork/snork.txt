This is the Snork player model by Kray-Zee!  The weapon.pcx is courtesy of NegativeKreep

Unzip this to the folder CONTAINING your quake2 folder!  For example, if your 
Quake 2 folder is c:\quake2 then unzip this to c:\
If these files do not end up in quake2\baseq2\players\snork then they won't work, so put 'em
there if you unzipped it wrong.

Start up a game of Quake 2, and go to the Multiplayer menu.  Choose the Snork model.  Frag.

Weirdness:  When I unzipped this on my brothers computer, it worked fine.  When I tried 
            unzipping it on MY computer, it didn't work.  I had to reinstall Quake 2.  
            Also, in GL the skin looks yellow.  In software and v1k, it is it's proper
            orange color.
