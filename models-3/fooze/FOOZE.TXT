Build/Animation time    : i started working on it sometime after xmas -97, trying to
learn bones and ik in lightwave, so ive been playing around with it now and then for the last 7 
months (the baseframe and many skins was finnished like long before anyone even tought about wasted
skin space limits and such, explains the high (61%) wastedspace)
