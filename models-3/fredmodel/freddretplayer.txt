* Notes *
Tested on slower machines...
If anyone knows how to assign sounds to a plug in player model 
pretty please tell me. If it takes recompiling the code .. 
it would be neat if someone wrote a text parser for player sounds
eg:

<whatever model>= sounds\<model dir name>
<this other model>= sounds\<this other model dir name>
anyway ..
