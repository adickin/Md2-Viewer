This is my first time to experiment with Quake programming so go easy on me.
This was basically just an experiment to see if i could actually get it to work
because i was planning on making my own model and making it vwep compatible. 
Once i got the first one working i thought what the hell i'll go ahead and finish
it out.  It took for freaking ever tho because i couldn't get crap to work right, 
i had to end up importing and exporting all the frames of animation individually
as well as placing the weapons right to follow the model's animation.  
The original model uses a sword so some of the bigger weapons like the rocket 
launcher intersect into the body on some frames.. i couldn't help this.  Also her 
hand was really small which made it a pain in the @$$ to place the weapon handles
right.  But other than that, hell, at least you can tell which weapon she has now!
