* Notes *

If anyone wants the original Lightwave files to make Vweapons or 
if you just want to mangle the player model email me. The scenes 
have a gun null or bone, I just didn't bother because at the time 
I made the model Vwep was a mod and not built into Quake2.
P.S. for a later model I made new id weapon bases to work with in 
Lightwave. If you need them Email me.
