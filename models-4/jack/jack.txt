Editor:		Quake2 Model Editor v0.83
Description:	Jack is a new player model for Quake2.
		Basically, he is a psychotic jack-in-the-box.

Installation:

	Unzip all the files into a sundirectory called "jack" in your
	players directory.  You can then select Jack in the player
	setup menu in Quake 2.

Skins:

	Hey, I'm getting better at skins!  Even though I will probably
	make more skins for Jack in the future, I still want to see
	any skins you make, if you choose to do so.  Please send them
	to the email address mentioned above.

Sounds:

	I wanted to include sounds with this model, but I'm not very
	good at making them.  I may find time to make a sound pack to
	go with Jack, but if you make one before I do, send it to the
	email address mentioned above.

Comments:

	If you have any comments, please send them to the email address
	mentioned above.

Have fun with Jack!
