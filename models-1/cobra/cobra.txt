Model description       : A cobra with bonus lower fangs!  Stroggos is 
infested with snakes; some have fallen into the bio-vats and come out 
breathing rockets, coughing up grenades, and spitting buck-shot.  These 
creatures die with a shriek and leave a mere snake skin behind.  When 
wounded, they can sometimes grow their head back.
