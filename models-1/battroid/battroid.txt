This is my very first attempt at 3d modelling, made from the very 
first cube I attempted making, just last week.  It was a great 
learning experience, and I intend to try my hand at making many
more models, hopefully much better than this, now that I know the 
basics.  Enjoy.

Xenoid, my second Q2 player plugin model is now available, and it's a
real treat.  Go find it where you found this.
