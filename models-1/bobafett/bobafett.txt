I've always wanted to be Boba Fett in every 3d game I've played.  
I started with Boba Fett player sprites in Doom and Doom II, made
a number of Boba Fett skins for Quake, made Boba Fett skin for the
Quake 2 male model, and now I've progressed to a whole new player
model made from scratch.  

I'm as big an accuracy freak as anyone on this subject.  I made 3 
different skins depicting the 3 major variations of the Boba Fett
costume, each with accurate variations in color, markings, and damage.

ROTJ_Fett - Fett as he appeared in Return of the Jedi, w/ 2 red 
gauntlets, multicolored jetpack, green cape, and overall faded and
weathered appearance.

ESB_Fett - Fett as he appeared in The Empire Strikes Back, with green/
gray gauntlets and jetpack, and 2 tone brown cape.

Prototype_Fett - the major prototype phase from movie pre-production 
(many of the publicity photos that were released were this variation,
which was used as the basis for the original toys), with red and yellow
gauntlets, green cape, multicolored jetpack, non-final shoulder symbol,
brown gloves, blue/grey jumpsuit (color hadn't been totally washed out
yet), and overall brightly colored.  

On the other hand, limitations of poly count and skin resolution forced
me to make a few minor omissions, most noteworthy the lack of wookie
scalp braids hanging from the shoulder.  

I decided to make Boba use his gauntlet weapons for the weapons rather 
than have him carry a gun (I couldn't do 3 different guns to match the
various costume stages anyway).  I used the weapon.md2 for the weapon
blasts, jetpack blasts (used on the jump), and for Boba's head (exposed 
on the taunt sequence).  I took some liberty with Boba's head, and 
made him appear badly damaged and bandaged up after that nasty incident
with the Sarlaac.  

The other 2 skins are CTF skins, for use with Threewave CTF for Quake2.

I decided not to do sounds, since the default male sounds will suffice, 
but a custom sound or two, perhaps for the jetpack jump, would be nice.
Anybody who wants to have a try at it, please send me what you come up
with.
